This is a Particle system for Panda3D, the physics for it is run on the GPU using ping-pong buffers.

Check the main.py to see how the particle data can be genereated and saved.
Check the main2.py to see how to load a particle system from a file.
Check the editor.py to see how a editor will work - It's not all that working now, but you can give it some values and click 'generate' to see the effects - or not, it's WIP!!
